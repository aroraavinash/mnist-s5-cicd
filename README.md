# MNIST Classifier

A PyTorch-based deep learning project for MNIST digit classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Project Structure 
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- PyTorch >= 1.8.0
- torchvision >= 0.9.0
- numpy >= 1.21.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd [repo-name]
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory with the filename format: `mnist_model_acc{accuracy}_{timestamp}.pth`

### Running Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Runs unit tests
- Trains the model
- Saves the trained model as an artifact

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of:
- 2 convolutional layers
- 2 max pooling layers
- 2 fully connected layers
- ReLU activation functions

The model is designed to achieve >80% accuracy on the MNIST test set.
